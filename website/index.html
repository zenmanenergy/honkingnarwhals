				<h2>What is FIRST Robotics?</h2>
				<p>FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition is an international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams of high school students, coaches, and mentors work during a six-week period to build robots capable of competing in that year's game that weigh up to 125 pounds.</p>
				
				<p>FIRST Robotics combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team brand, hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors.</p>
