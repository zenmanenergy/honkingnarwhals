                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>The Honking Narwhals, FIRST Robotics Team 9214, is a dedicated group of high school students from Norfolk, Virginia, united by our passion for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Our team name represents our unique spirit - just like the narwhal's distinctive tusk, we stand out in our creativity and innovation.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build engineering and technology skills, inspire innovation, and foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>

                <h2>Our Home</h2>
                <p>We are proud to call <strong>757 Makerspace</strong> our home. This incredible facility in Norfolk, VA provides us with access to professional-grade equipment, tools, and a collaborative environment that fosters creativity and innovation. The makerspace allows us to prototype, design, and build our competition robots while learning real-world engineering skills.</p>
